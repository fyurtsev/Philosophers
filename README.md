# Philosophers

This project is aimed at multi-threaded/multi-process programming using mutexes and semaphores. 
The task is to write a program that simulates the Famous Philosophers problem.

```
- Several philosophers are sitting around a round table and doing one of three things: 
  eating, thinking, or sleeping.
- They do not think or sleep while eating, and they do not eat while sleeping. And of course, 
  they do not eat while thinking or sleeping.
- The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
- There are some forks on the table.
- Since it is difficult to serve and eat spaghetti with only one fork, each philosopher 
  must use two forks, one for each hand, to eat.
- If the given parameters are correct, the philosophers should never die of starvation.
- Each philosopher must eat.
- The philosophers do not talk to each other.
- A philosopher does not know when another philosopher will die.
- When a philosopher finishes eating, they fall asleep.
- When a philosopher wakes up from sleep, they start thinking.
- If a philosopher dies, the simulation ends.
